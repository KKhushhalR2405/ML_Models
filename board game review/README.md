# Board Game Rating Prediction

### Dataset : [Link](https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/tree/master/boardgamegeek)

### Machine Learning Algorithm Used

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest

## Result

* Mean squared error for Linear Regression model : 2.078
* Mean squared error for Random Forest model : 1.456

Clearly, Random Forest performed better because the training dataset lacked linear dependency and hence Non-Linear model performed better than Linear model
